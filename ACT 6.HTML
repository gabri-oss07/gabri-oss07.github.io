       My father's name is Demetrio B. Tubat Jr.(55), and my mother is Rebecca M. Tubat(52). I have four siblings
       namely Uzziah John(26)the eldest,Zoe Micah(23),Josiah Jay(21) and the youngest,Jonathan Dave(14).I am fourth
       in my siblings. My father's occupation is a Pastor and my mother is a housewife.Growing up with my family 
       comes with many problems especially with the financial but throughout our lives,God has continually providing
       us with His blessings, I remember when I was a child we don't have anything to eat and we only harvested the 
       leaves or udlot from the Saluyot which we cooked it as a soup and that was our only meal. I am thankful that 
       the we overcome the hardships and problems we ecounter with our lives.

       My favorite sport before was Sepak Takraw because i find it fascinating and with the skills. I started playing 
       takyan when i was in 3rd Grade and then joined my first district matched in 4th Grade but unfortunately we lost
       the game. But that defeat didnt stop me i continue to play till i was in grade 5 and then we moved to Malaybalay
       Bukidnon in 2018,there i stop playing because i lose interest in it and i didnt have friends to play with. Fast 
       forward to covid-19 we are stuck in our homes and we couldn't get out because of lockdown so we are forced to
       stay in our homes and i played a lot of mobile games from evening to morning consuming a lot of time. And in August
       of 2022 we moved back here in Ipil where i then started playing again my favorite sport but we only got into district
       palaro because we lacked skills and training compared to other schools.I did not excel in Sepak Takraw and I'm disappointed
       with myself. And then i switched to running where i can be myself and my only competition is my past self. I have been
       running since May of 2025 and i can see improvements and im still continuing to run not just to get my pr's but also to 
       have an active body and make new friends in the running community.
